# WIDS Project
This repository contains our submission for the WiDS Datathon 2025, where our team ranked *97th out of 1,075 teams worldwide*, placing in the *top 10%* with an overall accuracy of 78.04%!

##🏆 About WiDS 2025
 WiDS Datathon 2025 was organized by Stanford University’s WiDS initiative, on Kaggle and built in collaboration with the Child Mind Institute and the Ann S. Bowers Women's Brain Health Initiative. 
 
##📌 The challenge:
Predict ADHD diagnoses and biological sex using fMRI time-series data and detailed patient info from the Healthy Brain Network.

##Participants were challenged to predict:
ADHD diagnosis (classification)
Biological sex (classification)
This multimodal dataset tested both technical and domain-specific skills at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.

> 📢 _This work is currently under review and will be published soon._

## 🧠 Summary

The study is based on experimental data from 1,127 concrete specimens with varied fly ash content (0%–30%) and thermal exposure (ambient to 1000°C). A range of supervised machine learning models were evaluated.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
-Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
-NumPy – for numerical computing
-Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization
-Scikit-learn – for preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling:
-SelectKBest 
-StandardScaler for normalization
-LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, etc. for classification
-LightGBM 

##📍 Platform & Environment
Jupyter Notebook (Python 3)

 
  ##💡 Our best-performing models:
 - ADHD Prediction → SelectKBest + LightGBM
 - Sex Prediction → SelectKBest + Logistic Regression
