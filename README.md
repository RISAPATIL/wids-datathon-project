## 🏆 About WiDS 2025

The **WiDS Datathon 2025** was organized by **Stanford University’s WiDS initiative**, hosted on **Kaggle**, and built in collaboration with:
- **Child Mind Institute**
- **Ann S. Bowers Women's Brain Health Initiative**

---

## 📌 The Challenge

Participants were tasked with predicting two clinical variables based on neuroscience data:
- **ADHD diagnosis** (classification)
- **Biological sex** (classification)

The dataset included **fMRI time-series data** and **detailed patient information** from the **Healthy Brain Network**. This multimodal dataset required blending domain knowledge from **neuroscience** with **machine learning** expertise.

> 📢 This work is currently under review and will be published soon.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – for numerical computing  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – for preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling:
  - `SelectKBest`
  - `StandardScaler`
  - `LogisticRegression`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, etc.  
- **LightGBM** – for gradient boosting classification  

---

## 📍 Platform & Environment

- **Jupyter Notebook** (Python 3)
